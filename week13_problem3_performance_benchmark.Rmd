Benchmark the performance of two different functions- one using base R library and the other using the dplyr library.

The function is to get the average flight departure delay.  Then publish to rpubs.com. 

```{r}

library(DBI)
library(RPostgreSQL)
library(dplyr)
library(reshape2)
library(microbenchmark)
library(nycflights13)
flt_data <- flights

# compare dplyr to base R apply()
# clearly dplyr works faster than the base R function.
flt_data <- flights
# compare dplyr to base R apply()
# clearly dplyr works faster than the base R function.
measure_perf <- microbenchmark(
  apply(flt_data[4],2,mean,na.rm = TRUE),
  summarize(flt_data,avg_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
  )

measure_perf

```

The results show clearly that dplyr has superior performance as compared to the base R apply() function.
